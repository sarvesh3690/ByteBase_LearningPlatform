Built a full-stack e-learning platform using React.js and Spring Boot, where teachers can upload assignments, 
class notes, and PDFs, and students can access them. Integrated a dedicated coding platform using Microsoft 
Monaco Editor, allowing students to write and test code directly within the platform. 
Implemented a secure backend with Hibernate and MySQL and added role-based authentication 
(JWT, Spring Security) for Admin, Teacher, and Student access. This project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, 
file handling, authentication, and interactive coding environments.
